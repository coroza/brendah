Most say the best skill for someone to be a Life Coach is one’s own life experience. I have lived life as a single mom, a wife and a stepmom in an incredible blended family. I have mourned the death of friends and a parent and faced the devastation of the loss of a marriage. I have celebrated incredible highs and mourned devastating lows.

And that’s just been the first half of my life.

Through all my struggles and triumphs, I always knew that eventually I wanted to get to a stage where I could help other people along their journeys. And so, here I am, living my dream.
